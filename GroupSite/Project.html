                        Students at OU struggle to find reliable and detailed information about professors, classes, housing, and campus resources because the current options are scattered, limited, or outdated. Most students rely on word of mouth or generic sites like RateMyProfessor and Google reviews, which don't provide enough detail for real decision making. This becomes a problem especially during enrollment, housing searches, and when students need honest campus advice but don't know where to look.

                        ReviewOU solves this problem by putting all OU-specific reviews and cmapus information in one place. The site includes professor and class ratings, housing reviews, campus like feedback, a Q&A board, and tools like search and filters to help students find exactly what they need. By keeping everything centralized and letting students post with their OU login, the platform becomes more reliable, easier to use, and more helpful for making decisions about classes, housing, and everyday campus life.
